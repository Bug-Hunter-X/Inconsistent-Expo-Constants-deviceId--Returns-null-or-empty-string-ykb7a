This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceId` API to obtain a unique device identifier.  In certain situations, particularly when dealing with background processes or after an app restart, `Constants.deviceId` may return `null` or an empty string, even though a device ID should exist. This inconsistency causes issues in scenarios where a unique identifier is crucial for features such as user authentication, analytics, or push notifications.  The problem is exacerbated when the app is running in the background or after being killed and restarted by the system.
